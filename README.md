## Introduction
Matrices look beautiful as well as are highly useful for both Data Manipulation & Getting marks in exams.
But performing those calculations can drill deep into your mind and are prone to silly mistakes.  
To make such work easier, this project exists. :wink:

## Features

- Currently Determinant, Addition, Product, Inverse and Rank of matrix are implemented
- Supports matrix order upto 4
- Accepts input as integers, decimals or even from fractions
- Proper Error Handling
- Sleek & Minimalist design

## Roadmap
+ Support mathematical functions like sqrt(), sin(), cos() etc.
+ Add more single value functions such as Minors, Co-factors, Adjoint etc.  
+ Show Human-Friendly steps followed to reach respective result
+ **_Any Improvements or Added Features are heartly welcomed._**
