## Introduction
Matrices look beautiful as well as are highly useful for both Data Manipulation & Getting marks in exams.
But performing those calculations can drill deep into your mind and are prone to silly mistakes.  
To make such work easier, this project exists. :wink:

## Roadmap
+ Currently, only calculation of *Determinant* has been implemeted. There is a need to insert more functions like following:
+ Add more single value functions such as Rank of Matrix, Minors, Co-factors, Adjoint etc.  
+ Add Multiple matrix functions like Addition, Subtraction, Inverse of matrix, Multiplication etc.
+ Add Matrix Transformation functions like Inverse of Matrix, Elementary Operations etc.
+ Show Human-Friendly steps followed to reach respective result
+ **_Any Improvements or Added Features are heartly welcomed._**
